**PETMON** is in many ways, an inevitable extension of the growing “Internet of Things”  or "IoT", a term nowadays commonly used to describe an increasing digital connectivity through which everyday items—and now pets—can be accessed, monitored, and even controlled via the Internet.

**PETMON** can notify owners of their pet's physical activity, location, environmental information and basic health stats. With so much information in the owner's hands, they can now not only keep track of their pet's whereabouts but also keep a watch on the step count, pulse rate, body and environmental temperature of their pet and most importantly set up GPS boundaries for them.
